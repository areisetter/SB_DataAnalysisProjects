    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Question 1:  What test is appropriate?  Does CLT apply?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, the data (both independent [apparent race] and dependent [callback] variables) are binary, not normally distributed, so CLT doesn't apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a correlation test appropriate for binary variables.  I think the most appropriate version is known as the Phi test, which is basically a chi squared test (and the equivalent of a Pearson test for binary quantities).  Apparently sklearn has a version called matthews_corrcoef (this is the first time I've looked for it in python). The documentation for pearson says that it assumes normalized distributions, so the phi test is what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT I actually ran it both ways below, and I got the same correlation coefficient using both pearsonr and matthews_corrcoef out to 4 sigfigs, so it looks like it works either way.  And the built-in pearsonr provides a p-value (rather than just a correlation coefficient), so I'm happy to use that.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a chance that the unstated intent here is for me to use the bootstrapping method described in the DataCamp course and use the p-value as the test statistic, but since I'm not sure whether that's asked for here, and it hardly seems necessary, I'll start by not doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that the preceived race of the applicant does not affect whether they get called by the emplyer.\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis is that the perceived race of the applicant does affect whether they get called by the employer.  The direction of the correlation, if it exists, is most likely to indicate that a black-sounding name is less likely to be called back.\n"
